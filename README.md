## Hey there! I'm Savannah!

### What I'm working on
I'm an engineer working as a senior product manager at Microsoft focused on Azure cloud native developer tools and end-to-end experience. I'm the product lead for the open source [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev), which accelerates the time it takes for a developer to take an application from local development environment to the cloud (in minutes! with a single step! it rules!).

I'm also pretty passionate about the Python community and previously worked as the product manager for the [Pylance language server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) and on Python developer experience and productivity in products like VS Code, Visual Studio and on Azure.
