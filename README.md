## Hey there! I'm Savannah.

- ✨ I'm currently a Technical Program Manager at Google, working to make it easier for developers to build multi-device experiences.

- 🐍 Previously, I was the program manager for the [Pylance language server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) at Microsoft, working to improve Python developer experience and productivity in products like VS Code, Visual Studio and on Azure. Before that, I worked as an engineer at a variety of startups and consultancies.

- 👥 I have a master's degree from the University of Washington in [Human-Centered Design and Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/). I pursued this degree part-time for just about three years while working and it's probably one of the best investments I've ever made. This degree is part of the reason that I will talk to just about anyone that will listen about leveraging user research as a means of connecting and understanding developer audiences.

- 📚 You can read about some of what I've worked on via [the Microsoft Python team blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/author/saostrow/) or read about [how I approach improving products using quantitative and qualitative data](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/experimentation-platform-exp/articles/measurably-improve-your-product-by-combining-qualitative-and-quantitative-methods/). You can also listen to me nerd out about [Python things](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/28/) or [why developer experience is user experience](https://www.uxpursuit.com/savannah-ostrowski) on a podcast or two.

- 🛠 I like [exploring ways to make engineering more accessible to folks with less traditional backgrounds](https://www.physidig.com/), geeking out about qualitative research (and why it's undeniably important in building good products), the user experience of programming languages, coffee, spending too much money on mechanical keyboards, playing World of Warcraft (🔮 main: night elf demon hunter, havoc spec), watching documentaries, and cooking overly elaborate meals on weekday nights.

- 💾 I'm pretty much always learning about _something_. Right now, it's  Go, cloud native architecture, Kubernetes, and how to garden in the Pacific Northwest.

- 🐈🐈 I have not one but two cats. They're named after food things ([Nori and Miso](https://twitter.com/savostrowski/status/1370063077454929921))!
