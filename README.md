# **Hey there👋! I'm Savannah!** 

- 🐍 I'm a [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython) Core Developer, maintaining the JIT[^1][^2] and the argparse module.
- 🛠 I lead Python developer experience at Snowflake, currently focused on APIs (like [snowflake](https://pypi.org/project/snowflake/), [snowflake.core](https://pypi.org/project/snowflake.core/), [snowflake.demos](https://pypi.org/project/snowflake.demos/)) and Python runtime support across Snowpark, Notebooks, Streamlit in Snowflake, etc.
- 💚 I'm also working on `ouro` - a way to generate GitHub Actions from pure Python code.
- 👩‍💻 I love Python, Go, containers, DevOps, open source software, and cats!
- 🐈 I have three cats named after Japanese foods - Nori, Miso & Momo
