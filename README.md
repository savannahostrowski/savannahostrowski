## Hey there! I'm Savannah.

- ✨ I'm a Technical Program Manager at Google on the [Better Together](https://www.android.com/better-together/) team, working to make it easier to build multi-device experiences across the Google device ecosystem.

- 🐍 Previously, I was the program manager for the [Pylance language server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) at Microsoft, working to improve developer experience and productivity in products like VS Code. Before that, I worked as an engineer at a variety of startups and consultancies.

- 📚 You can read about some of what I've worked on via [the Microsoft Python team blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/author/saostrow/), or listen to me nerd out about [Python things](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/28/) or [why developer experience is user experience](https://www.uxpursuit.com/savannah-ostrowski) on a podcast or two.

- 🛠 I like [physical computing](https://www.physidig.com/), geeking out about qualitative research methods, cold brew coffee, spending too much money on mechanical keyboards, playing World of Warcraft (🔮 main: night elf demon hunter, havoc spec), and cooking overly elaborate meals on weekday nights.

- 💾 I'm pretty much always learning about _something_. Right now, it's WebAssembly, compilers and Go.

- 🐈🐈 I have not one but two cats. They're named after food things ([Nori and Miso](https://twitter.com/savostrowski/status/1370063077454929921))!
