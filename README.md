## Hey there! I'm Savannah.

- ✨ I’m a software engineer working as a program manager at Microsoft, improving Python developer experience and productivity.

- 🐍 I primarily work on [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance), Python in the browser via vscode.dev/github.dev, and trying to wrap my head around the general Python language ecosystem (packaging, virtual environments, runtimes, type annotations).

- 🛠 I like [physical computing](https://www.physidig.com/), cold brew coffee, spending too much money on mechanical keyboards, playing World of Warcraft (🔮 main: night elf demon hunter, havoc spec), and cooking overly elaborate meals on weekday nights.

- 🐈🐈 I have not one but two cats. They're named after food things ([Nori and Miso](https://twitter.com/savostrowski/status/1370063077454929921))!

- ✉ Chat with me on Twitter, @savostrowski (but please don't **ever** call me Sav).
